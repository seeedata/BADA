bbfan,5.0,"I did not receive part of the order. I did not receive the perfume bottle, only the vial. I paid for the bottle."
SEF,1.0,"I’ve been wearing a Chanel *5 since inwas 25, and it’s always been pricey….but for $17 you are getting spa ar bottle tnst thrybgivr away for free at the fragrance counters.  One was broken and I sliced the side of my finger open.  I still haven’t heard back from the shipper.  Im disappointed snd upset ."
Laura C. Barmettler,1.0,"The bottle is ONLY 2 inches tall and 3/4"" radius.  The bottle is also stamped as a sample NOT FOR RESALE!  QUITE A DISAPPOINTMENT.  And the price!!!!!! for what you get!!!!"
Stacy P,1.0,"I would have liked to use it. I love ❤ Chanel. Unhappily, they were in pieces, like someone stepped on them and then packed.  Amazon said they don't refund but would forward. Never heard from the forward. I know I'm being a cranky old lady but $31 for two samples it's a lot of money for my these days."
WeddingChris,1.0,"What a shame and a scam.  This appears to be authentic BUT the real test is the scent.  It smells like old lady's britches... AWFUL.  And, it's non-returnable.  Try is you like wasting money.  Sad.  I was taken."
mimisgrand7,1.0,"This is a wonderful, light, fresh scent.  I love it!"
Lisa,4.0,I was very disappointed to receive a tiny vial in the mail for $16.  You get the same vial for free at department stores.  On top of all of this the vial was cracked and the vendor has a no return policy.
Lisett Moll,1.0,"Desagradable todo, no es el pomo que se ve en la foto,  es una muestra que la consigues free en Macys,  el cartón dice "" not for sale "", sin embargo cobran 18 dólares por un tester."
PAMELA JONES,1.0,"Myself, it has a very soft scent that last all day.💯"
Pen Name,5.0,I posted a review of of the seller earlier that was less than good. I wasn't satisfied with the size of the product but after my second attempt to reach out to the vendor I received a return address and the vendor refunded my money in full
Ena Aloush,1.0,"The spray perfume sample smell of old cologne, never orders from this seller again."
VALERIE BAYLOR,1.0,It's too small...I assume it would have been larger
Kim,1.0,This product appears to be what is given away for free at perfume counter. Seller has a  no return policy.
AV,1.0,"미디어를 로드할 수 없습니다.
                



 The description reads eau de perfume, which is what I've always used, but this is eau the toilette, and the scent is quite annoying. Amazon WON'T allow refund or return of this product."
Amazon Customer,1.0,Not all too happy to be scammed out of 50% of the product promised
Kimberly Foster,1.0,"Smells bad, not even close to what it should smell like! I got ripped off"
David Kingery,4.0,"This is not Chanel number five, I know what it smells like it smells gross like toilet cleaner. I’m not allowed to return or get a refund. Terrible company"
Peter Walker,1.0,The TINY sample was half empty due to it leaking ibside packet
F. Counihan,1.0,One use took half the container.  The amount is like a sample.  For $60 a MAJOR RIP OFF1
Kelly Hankins,1.0,I really wanted to like this but it smelled horrible like something that a 90 year old grandma would use.
Pat,1.0,It was toilet water alright
Reggie,1.0,The scent (smell) was weird and seemed to get worse as I wore it. I tossed mine

TK,5.0,プレゼント用に購入しましたが、残念ながら箱出し状態で、中身のみ届きました…
Amazon Customer,3.0,"Classic beautiful scent, but softer.Very lovely"
佐藤,5.0,プレゼントで喜んで貰えた
mai,4.0,ほぼ、NO5なのですが、100周年記念すべきNO5ローは、白檀の香りも入って、甘さが控えめで、入りやすい香りだと思います
Kay Fleetham,4.0,"I wear Chanel no5 but it is heavy especially during the summer months. About Christmas time, I tried a sample of this new Chanel l’eau and I loved the  light Powderly base to this fragrance. I received an Amazon voucher for my birthday and I decided that I will get a bottle of this. Will be my new scent for this summer."
DEAN ALLEN,5.0,the sailer did not say l'eau de toilette or l'eau de perfum and it charged  35% more than any othersaler on amzon
下北沢ガール,2.0,当時マリリンモンローの愛用品で有名もちろん海外CHANELしか無かったかもしれないナンバー5。ココシャネル展に感化されてしまいました。ネット上で買えるなんて凄い時代ですね。
"SUE, SHROPSHIRE",3.0,"Having tried 'Chanel No 5' about 40 years ago and not liked it AT ALL (under-statement), I was intrigued to try this fragrance and boy, was I hooked - so much so that it's become my 'signature fragrance' and so will it forever be.  Yes, it's pricey because it's new (Amazon have amazing deals, so will definitely re-order) but it's worth every single penny if you like a light, subtle waft of fragrance rather than a bold, overpowering one.As to how to define the fragrance - well, it's NOT musky (ie no Sandalwood, Amber tones): it has a powdery fragrance, very light, slightly floral with some indefinable notes that make it linger, but not cloying.  I would say that even people who don't like or wear florals will like this.  Everyone with whom you come into contact will ask what fragrance you are wearing, it's that subtle and unique and I congratulate Chanel on what will surely become their No.1 fragrance in time."
David Bompas,5.0,The product was good.  My wife liked it.
you,4.0,楽天で、少しの量で買って、香りが気に入って、少しでも安くて量がある、こちらで、買いました。やはり、高いけど、いい香りです。
domani,5.0,定番の香りが素晴らしい
Octavian,5.0,My wife loved it
Robert Morley,5.0,"Chanel's new No. 5 is heaven sent, or should it be heaven scent. Really a stunningly elegant fragrance that harps back to the classic No. 5 but with a modern twist. Could not recommend enough."
sue kononowicz,5.0,"This is my favourite  perfume to wear every day, the 100m will last me a long time so worth the money."
Scott C.,5.0,Wasn’t bought by me or as gift so I can’t review
Barbara Penn,5.0,"So much nicer than No. 5, which is too heavy on me and everyone else I've ever smelled it on!"
Cindy,5.0,Fav perfume!!
Tina Leggs ,5.0,Fantastic service fantastic product .
Y,5.0,配送は迅速できれいに梱包されていました。つけてすぐより、少し時間が経ってからの匂いが好きです。
M,4.0,お値段が安いので心配でしたが、箱にナイロン包装がしてあり、その上から香水箱のカバーに入っており丁重でした。香りはシャネルらしい一筋縄ではいかない独特の香りで、私は大好きですが好き嫌いが分かれる香りだと思います。No5の香りを柔らかくした、とても良い香りです。リピもこちらのショップでしたいと思います。
はやちん,5.0,最高！
MR C,5.0,"1st Class item and price!  Delivery was 6 days early!  ""Wow""!  Thank you."
NGUYEN TU,5.0,良いよ早く運んた。

Amazon カスタマー,5.0,前回購入した時と違って、商品の箱のビニールが剥がされていた状態！商品に不安を感じた❗️
トマト,3.0,今一番好きな香り。なくなったらリピートします。次は大きいの買います。
